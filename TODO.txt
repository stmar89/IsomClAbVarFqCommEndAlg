- clean up
- input should be of Type IsogenyClass
- Move PlacesAboveRationalPrime to AlgEtQ. Now in DieudonneModules.m
- ramification index, inertia degree, valuation and maybe nice_uniformizer should be intrinsics in AlgEtQ
  Now they are in PrimesAttributes.m
- Add references to the paper (scan for ADDREF, some might be missing)
- Add duality in DieudonneModules.m


FIX
