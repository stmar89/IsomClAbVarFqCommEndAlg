- clean up
- input should be of Type IsogenyClass
- slopes of primes should be stored in attributes
- ramification index, inertia degree, valuation and maybe nice_uniformizer should be intrinsics in AlgEtQ
- add verbose printing
- move some assert to assert2
- Add references to the paper (scan for ADDREF, some might be missing)
- Add duality in DieudonneModules.m


FIX
h:=x^2+5
one place of slope nu in (0 1)
g_nu=1
L=Cyclotomic Field of order 4 and degree 2
A:=Number Field with defining polynomial x^4 + 12*x^2 + 16 over the Rational Field
A has 2 primes above nu
